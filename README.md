This is my attempt to understand and solve, Kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

This dataset had a large number of columns, 81 of them, hence I created my own data exploration functions which could be later put as a python package.
Please refer to [Code_ver1.ipynb](https://github.com/avmchandrish/kaggle1-house-prices-prediction/blob/master/Code_ver1.ipynb) to refer to the usage of the these functions.

The EDA functions written using Seaborn and Matplotlib can be found in:
1. sns_eda.py
2. EDA_module.py
